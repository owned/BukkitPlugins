BukkitPlugins
=============
Points Plugin for Donations/Votes Outline
	
	MySQL Based for hub's and multiserver community's 
	Automated Rewards for x amount of people who have the top votes/donations for that month
	Make it Economy based or item based or both changeable via config(diamonds or whatever they use instead of a economy plugin)
	Have to ability to make vote points generate over time for active users
		-possibly add my own anti-afk system in this to prevent scumb-bagery.
	


Some basic ingame commands so far.
	addvpoints
	adddpoints
	removevpoints
	removedpoints
	voteshop
	donorshop
	
Commands Listed above are not set and most likely will change.



Future development.
	Add the ability to make sales for points aswell as extra vote points
	Make the plugin utilize a web-based interface/control panel php based
	Allow them to set auto announcements when sales are going on.
	integrate the database into a php page people can view how many points they have from out of the game and to show the leaderboards
